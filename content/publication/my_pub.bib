We have recently proposed new implicit-explicit methods of general linear type (IMEX-GLMs) in [11, 10]. It was shown that no additional coupling order conditions are needed, and consequently that GLMs offer an excellent framework for the construction of multi-method integration algorithms.

An essential component of their performance is the storage/recomputation balance in which efficient adjoint checkpointing strategies play a key role. We introduce a novel asynchronous two-level adjoint checkpointing scheme for numerical time discretizations targeted at large-scale numerical simulations. The checkpointing scheme combines bandwidth-limited disk checkpointing and space-limited binomial memory checkpointing. Based on assumptions about the target petascale systems, which we later demonstrate to be realistic on the IBM Blue Gene/Q system Mira, we create a model of the predicted performance of the adjoint computation and validate it using the highly scalable Navier-Stokes spectral-element solver Nek5000 on small to moderate subsystems of the Mira supercomputer.},

abstract = {Motif pairs can provide insight on how protein-protein interactions are encoded. Their discovery requires laborious and expensive biological experiments. Recently, Tan et al. proposed a computational approach to find motif pairs in the sequences of interacting proteins. However, their approach suffers from two drawbacks. The heuristic used in their approach is not accurate and may lead to a result including some false positive motif instances. Their approach is also not scalable. It may take days to process a set of 5000 protein sequences with about 20,000 interactions. We present in this work a new algorithm DMPCP, which finds motifs from a subset of proteins and then pairs them up according to Chi-squared scoring functions. Experiments on real biological datasets and simulated datasets show that our approach is efficient and can find actual motif pairs. We also evaluated our approach on simulated datasets with planted motif pairs. The results show that our approach can achieve high success rates when interaction data is insufficient. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Silent data corruptions (SDCs) are errors that corrupt the system or falsify results while remaining unnoticed by firmware or oper- ating systems. In numerical integration solvers, SDCs that impact the accuracy of the solver are considered significant. Detecting SDCs in high-performance computing is necessary because results need to be trustworthy and the increase of the number and complexity of com- ponents in emerging large-scale architectures makes SDCs more likely to occur. Until recently, SDC detection methods consisted in replicat- ing the processes of the execution or in using checksums (for example algorithm-based fault tolerance). Recently, new detection methods have been proposed relying onmathematical properties of numerical kernels or performing data analysis of the results modified by the application. None of those methods, however, provide a lightweight solution guaranteeing that all significant SDCs are detected. We propose a new method called Hot Rod as a solution to this problem. It checks and potentially cor- rects the data produced by numerical integration solvers. Our theoretical model shows that all significant SDCs can be detected. We present two detectors and conduct experiments on streamline integration from the WRFmeteorology application. Compared with the algorithmic detection methods, the accuracy of our first detector is increased by 52{\%} with a similar false detection rate. The second detector has a false detection rate one order of magnitude lower than these detection methods while improving the detection accuracy by 23 {\%}. The computational overhead is lower than 5{\%} in both cases. The model has been developed for an explicit Runge-Kutta method, although it can be generalized to other solvers.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Sensitivity analysis is an important tool for describing power system dynamic behavior in response to parameter variations. It is a central component in preventive and corrective control applications. The existing approaches for sensitivity calculations, namely, finite-difference and forward sensitivity analysis, require a computational effort that increases linearly with the number of sensitivity parameters. In this paper, we investigate, implement, and test a discrete adjoint sensitivity approach whose computational effort is effectively independent of the number of sensitivity parameters. The proposed approach is highly efficient for calculating sensitivities of larger systems and is consistent, within machine precision, with the function whose sensitivity we are seeking. This is an essential feature for use in optimization applications. Moreover, our approach includes a consistent treatment of systems with switching, such as dc exciters, by deriving and implementing the adjoint jump conditions that arise from state-dependent and time-dependent switchings. The accuracy and the computational efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated in comparison with the forward sensitivity analysis approach. This paper focuses primarily on the power system dynamics, but the approach is general and can be applied to hybrid dynamical systems in a broader range of fields.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Haplotype played an important role in the association studies of disease gene and drug responsivity over the past years, but the low throughput of expensive biological experiments largely limited its application. Alternatively, some efficient statistical methods were developed to deduce haplotypes from genotypes directly. Because these algorithms usually needed to estimate the frequencies of numerous possible haplotypes, the partition and ligation strategy was widely adopted to reduce the time complexity. The haplotypes were usually partitioned uniformly in the past, but recent studies showed that the haplotypes had their own block structure, which may be not uniform. More reasonable block partition and ligation strategy according to the haplotype structure may further improve the accuracy of individual haplotyping. RESULTS: In this article, we presented a simple algorithm for block partition and ligation, which provided better accuracy for individual haplotyping. The block partition and ligation could be completed within O(m(2) logm+m(2n)) time complexity, where m represented the length of genotypes and n represented the number of individuals. We tested the performance of our algorithm on both real and simulated dataset. The result showed that our algorithm yielded better accuracy with short running time.

Linearly implicit Runge-Kutta methods with approximate matrix factorization can solve efficiently large systems of differential equations that have a stiff linear part, e.g. reaction-diffusion systems. However, the use of approximate factorization usually leads to loss of accuracy, which makes it attractive only for low order time integration schemes. This paper discusses the application of approximate matrix factorization with high order methods; an inexpensive correction procedure applied to each stage allows to retain the high order of the underlying linearly implicit Runge-Kutta scheme. The accuracy and stability of the methods are studied. Numerical experiments on reaction-diffusion type problems of different sizes and with different degrees of stiffness illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {For many systems of differential equations modeling problems in science and engineering, there are natural splittings of the right hand side into two parts, one non-stiff or mildly stiff, and the other one stiff. For such systems implicit-explicit (IMEX) integration combines an explicit scheme for the non-stiff part with an implicit scheme for the stiff part. In a recent series of papers two of the authors (Sandu and Zhang) have developed IMEX GLMs, a family of implicit-explicit schemes based on general linear methods. It has been shown that, due to their high stage order, IMEX GLMs require no additional coupling order conditions, and are not marred by order reduction. This work develops a new extrapolation-based approach to construct practical IMEX GLM pairs of high order. We look for methods with large absolute stability region, assuming that the implicit part of the method is A- or L-stable. We provide examples of IMEX GLMs with optimal stability properties.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. In the numerical solution of partial differential equations using a method-of-lines approach, the availability of high order spatial discretization schemes motivates the development of sophisticated high order time integration methods. For multiphysics problems with both stiff and nonstiff terms implicit-explicit (IMEX) time stepping methods attempt to combine the lower cost advantage of explicit schemes with the favorable stability properties of implicit schemes. Existing high order IMEX Runge-Kutta or linear multistep methods, however, suffer from accuracy or stability limitations. This work shows that IMEX general linear methods (GLMs) are competitive alternatives to classic IMEX schemes for large problems arising in practice. High order IMEX-GLMs are constructed in the partitioned GLM framework developed earlier by the authors [J. Sci. Comput., 61(2014), pp. 119-144]. The stability regions of the new schemes are optimized numerically. The resulting IMEX-GLMs have similar stability properties as IMEX Runge-Kutta methods, but they do not suffer from order reduction and are superior in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The new IMEX-GLMs have considerably better stability properties than the IMEX linear multistep methods. Numerical experiments with two- and three-dimensional test problems illustrate the potential of the new schemes to speed up complex applications.},

We investigate the stability of the coupled ocean–atmosphere models for various interface conditions such as the Dirichlet–Neumann condition and the bulk interface condition, which is unique to climate modeling.
