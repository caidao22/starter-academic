abstract = "Implicit-explicit time stepping methods have proved useful for efficiently solving problems with both stiff and nonstiff components. IMEX Runge-Kutta methods and IMEX multistep methods have been studied in the literature. But there are no available IMEX general linear methods (IMEX-GLMs). In this paper, we construct IMEX schemes based on diagonally-implicit multi-stage integration methods. The new algorithms have great potential for practical use. Numerical results indicate the observed order of accuracy matches the theoretical order. textcopyright 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd."
