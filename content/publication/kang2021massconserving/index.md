abstract = "Earth  system  models  are  composed  of  coupled  components  that  separatelymodel systems such as the global atmosphere, ocean, and land surface.  Whilethese  components  are  well  developed,  coupling  them  in  a  single  system  canbe  a  significant  challenge.   Computational  efficiency,  accuracy,  and  stabilityare principal concerns.  In this study we focus on these issues.  In particular,implicit-explicit  (IMEX)  tight  and  loose  coupling  strategies  are  explored  forhandling different time scales.  For a simplified model for the air-sea interactionproblem, we consider coupled compressible Navier–Stokes equations with an in-terface condition.  Under the rigid-lid assumption,  horizontal momentum andheat flux are exchanged through the interface.  Several numerical experimentsare presented to demonstrate the stability of the coupling schemes.  We showboth numerically and theoretically that our IMEX coupling methods are massconservative for a coupled compressible Navier–Stokes system with the rigid-lidcondition."
